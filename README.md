# dowhileloop.cpp
This program demonstrates the working of a do-while loop in C++. The variable i is initialized with 2. Since do-while executes its body at least once, it prints "Hello World" before checking the condition. After printing, i becomes 3, and since i &lt;= 1 is false, the loop terminates.
